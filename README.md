The Hospital Management System project provides an efficient 
way to manage hospital operations through a user-friendly 
terminal-based system. It includes separate menus for 
patients, doctors, staff members, and pharmacy management, 
offering essential services like appointment scheduling, billing, 
patient tracking, and medicine purchasing.

Objectives:
• Enable patients to schedule appointments with doctors, 
view appointment details, and calculate their hospital 
bills.
• Provide doctors with a simple interface to view their 
assigned patients.
• Allow hospital staff members (Nurse and Ward Boy) to 
check daily room assignments.
• Facilitate pharmacy purchases through a dedicated 
menu.
